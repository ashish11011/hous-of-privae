            For us, fashion is more than fabric; it is confidence stitched into
            every seam, elegance woven into every detail, and individuality
            tailored with perfection.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe in the power of dressing - the way a well-curated attire
            can transform not only how the world sees you, but how you see
            yourself.

            Haus of Privae is a dream of bringing luxury, inclusivity, and

            shapes, crafted with sustainability in mind, and made to inspire you
            to step into your truest, boldest self.

          <p className="font-medium italic">
            Because when you dress with power, you don't just wear clothes - you

            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Haus of Privae began as a dream - a vision to create a space where
              luxury meets purpose.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              What started as a small idea grew from a deep belief: that
              clothing is not just about style, but about power, identity, and
              confidence.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Stitch by stitch, sketch by sketch, it became a studio where
              fashion is not only tailored to perfection but also conscious and
              sustainable.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              From its humble start to now, Haus of Privae continues to be a
              journey of passion, perseverance, and purpose - redefining luxury
              as something inclusive, empowering, and everlasting.
